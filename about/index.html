                I am a rapper/poet/music producer/political slacktivist/monster on the beats/man with a lot of opinions/genius/idiot.  I got more slashes than a Sandslash battle and more skills than a trades collegeâ€¦ WHAT!!!!! The quickest way to find out about me is to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMHHPBaiRk">check my music</a>.

                Now for those of you who didn't get distracted by the "Related Videos" after clicking the Youtube link and are still reading this, here is a bit more about me.  I go by Philosofly.  I like to think I put the "Swag" in social awareness.  I believe in saying meaningful things (Philoso-) but looking good while doing it (-fly).  I like making trippy sounding boundary pushing beats.  I am a fiend for anything that sounds new and different.  I like to rap about important global socio-political issues because, as an average ass powerless Toronto citizen watching from the sidelines, it feels like the only way I can have my opinions heard. I am also an accomplished spoken word poet that has won various competitions across Canada, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/361945">including the national title in 2013 at the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word</a>.
