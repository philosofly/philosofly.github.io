                Jason (Philosofly) Pennells was born and raised in the Greater Toronto Area.  He fell in love with hip hop at a young age and started making music using a $10 webcam mic and a demo version of Fruity Loops.  After graduating high school in Brampton he studied music production at Seneca College.  He worked at a lawn care company, a factory, a moving company and many other various jobs to pay for school and for equipment that was better than that webcam mic.

Today Philosofly is an accomplished spoken word poet, music producer and rapper.  He has won many poetry competitions including taking first place at the 2013 Canadian Festival of Spoken Word.  He has supplied beats for many local artists and has spent the years organizing and performing at hip hop events in Toronto.  His swagger filled, comedic, poetic approach to politics and social issues is what has audiences raving.  As he likes to proclaim at most of his shows, Philosofly "is all about saying deep shit (philoso-), but looking good while doing it(-fly)."  Combine this with his home-brewed spacey unconventional beats and the formula seems to be a recipe for success.  Philosofly dropped his first full length project "Da Nu World Di$order" at the beginning of 2015.
